      <br>I have a Cat,<br>
          She is not fat,<br>
          Because she doesn't eat kit-kats often.<br>

      <br>She chases rats,<br>
          She plays on her mat,<br>
          And she loves pet from mommy.<br>

      <br>Emerald is her name,<br>
          She is not to blame,<br>
          She was called that because she's pretty.<br>

      <br>She has no kittys,<br>
          Which is a pitty,<br>
          And, She is usually not giddy!

            Do you like Cheese Whiz? Spray tan? Fake eyelashes? That's what is Lorem Ipsum to many—it rubs them the wrong way, all the way. It's unreal, uncanny, makes you wonder if something is wrong, it seems to seek your attention for all the wrong reasons. Usually, we prefer the real thing, wine without sulfur based preservatives, real butter, not margarine, and so we'd like our layouts and designs to be filled with real words, with thoughts that count, information that has value.<br>
            The toppings you may chose for that TV dinner pizza slice when you forgot to shop for foods, the paint you may slap on your face to impress the new boss is your business. But what about your daily bread? Design comps, layouts, wireframes—will your clients accept that you go about things the facile way? Authorities in our business will tell in no uncertain terms that Lorem Ipsum is that huge, huge no no to forswear forever. Not so fast, I'd say, there are some redeeming factors<br> in<br>
